# tmux-1password

> Access your 1Password login items within tmux!

![](media/screenshot.gif)

This plugin allows you to access you 1Password items within tmux, using 1Password's CLI. It works
for personal 1Password accounts, as well as teams accounts.

## Requirements

This plugin relies on the following:

- [1Password CLI](https://support.1password.com/command-line-getting-started/)
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)

## Key bindings

In any tmux mode:

- `prefix + u` - list login items in a bottom pane.

## Install

### Using [Tmux Plugin Manager](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) (recommended)

1. Add plugin to the list of TPM plugins in `.tmux.conf`:

    ```
    set -g @plugin 'yardnsm/tmux-1password'
    ```

2. Hit `prefix + I` to fetch the plugin and source it. You should now be able to use the plugin.

### Manual Installation

1. Clone this repo:

    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/yardnsm/tmux-1password ~/some/path
    ```

2. Source the plugin in your `.tmux.conf` by adding the following to the bottom of the file:

    ```
    run-shell ~/some/path/plugin.tmux
    ```

3. Reload the environment by running:

    ```console
    $ tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
    ```

## Usage

First, sign in with 1Password CLI by running the following in your terminal (you only need to do
this *once*):

```console
$ op signin <signinaddress> <emailaddress> <secretkey>
```

For 1Password personal accounts, `<signinaddress>` should be `my.1password.com`. If you're using a
team account, configure the [`@1password-subdomain`](#setting-the-signin-subdomain) option.

From now on, initiate the plugin by using the keybind (`prefix + u` by default). A new pane will be
opened in the bottom, listing the appropriate login items. Press `<Enter>` to choose a login item,
and its password will automatically be filled.

You may be required to perform a re-login (directly in the opened pane) since the 1Password CLI's
sessions expires automatically after 30 minutes of inactivity.

### Configuring login items in 1Password

In order to show only relevant login items and to maintain compatibility with
[sudolikeaboss](https://github.com/ravenac95/sudolikeaboss), its required to set the value of the
`website` field for each login item with the value of `sudolikeaboss://local`.


## Configuration

Customize this plugin by setting these options in your `.tmux.conf` file. Make sure to reload the
environment afterwards.

#### Changing the default key-binding for this plugin

```
set -g @1password-key 'x'
```

Default: `u`

#### Setting the signin subdomain

```
set -g @1password-subdomain 'acme'
```

Default: `my`
